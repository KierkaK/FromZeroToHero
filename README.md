Bellow short instructions how to prepare your work environment to programming classes.

### 1. Create GitHub account
Open the link and follow instructions: https://github.com/join?source=login
I strongly recommend you to use your own email account, not corporate one.

### 2. Download and install GitBash
The tool can be obtained here: https://git-scm.com/download/win
If you have some questions on instalation process fill free to ask me.

### 3. Download and install Python
Yes, we're going to use Python as first programming language for backend. So distributive can be obtained at: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.1/python-3.6.1.exe . Installation process is simple, but please remember installation folder, you will need it later.

### 4. Download and install IDE
*IDE - is 'Integrated Development Environment'*
During ower classes we will use **PyCharm Community Edition**: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

### 5. Browser
I also expect to see as your browser Google Chrome of Firefox.
